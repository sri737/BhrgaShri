o set up an environment to start developing on conda code, we recommend the following steps:

Fork the conda/conda repository, clone it locally anywhere you choose (an isolation miniconda will be set up within the clone directory), and set up git remote to point to upstream and fork. For detailed directions, see below.
1a. Choose where you want the repository located (not location of existing conda)

CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT="$HOME/conda"
1b. Clone the project, with upstream being the main repository. Make sure to click the Fork button above so you have your own copy of this repo.

GITHUB_USERNAME=kalefranz
git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/conda "$CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT"
cd "$CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT"
git remote --add upstream git@github.com:conda/conda
Create a local development environment, and activate that environment
. dev/start
This command will create a project-specific base environment at ./devenv. If the environment already exists, this command will just quickly activate the already-created ./devenv environment.

To be sure that the conda code being interpreted is the code in the project directory, look at the value of conda location: in the output of conda info --all.

Run condaâ€™s unit tests using GNU make
make unit
or alternately with pytest

py.test -m "not integration and not installed" conda tests
or you can use pytest to focus on one specific test

py.test tests/test_create.py -k create_install_update_remove_smoketest
Development Environment, Windows cmd.exe shell
In these steps, we assume git is installed and available on PATH.

Choose where you want the project located
set "CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT=%HOMEPATH%\conda"
Clone the project, with origin being the main repository. Make sure to click the Fork button above so you have your own copy of this repo.
set GITHUB_USERNAME=kalefranz
git clone git@github.com:conda/conda "%CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT%"
cd "%CONDA_PROJECT_ROOT%"
git remote --add %GITHUB_USERNAME% git@github.com:%GITHUB_USERNAME%/conda
To be sure that the conda code being interpreted is the code in the project directory, look at the value of conda location: in the output of conda info --all.

Create a local development environment, and activate that environment
.\dev\start
This command will create a project-specific base environment at .\devenv. If the environment already exists, this command will just quickly activate the already-created .\devenv environment.
